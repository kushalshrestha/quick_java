SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES
================================================================
* Introduced by Robert C. Martin

1st Principle : SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Single class should have single responsibility
* One responsibility of a single class

2nd Principle : OCP - Open Closed Principle
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3rd Principle : LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
----------------------------------------------------------------
* You should be able to substitute a subclass for a base class.

4th Principle : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
----------------------------------------------------------------
* recommendation on how to split interface into smaller interfaces
* YAGNI -> You ain't going to need it i.e if you don't need it don't include it in the interface
Eg: Printer interface can have print(), scan() methods. But OldPrinter class when implements Printer interface they have to implement scan() method although old printers does not use to have.

Problem 1
Part C
==========
Here we have used HashMap and the code fails during execution because we should consider override of hashcode
when equals is overridden. Hence, in order to make the code execute properly, we need to add a hashCode() method:

@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		return Objects.hash(name, salary);
	}

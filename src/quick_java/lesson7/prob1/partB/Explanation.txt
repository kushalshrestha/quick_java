Problem 1
Part B
==========
The code fails because the equals method should overwrite a supertype method. And in the code the supertype refers to "Object" class which is the root of the class hierarchy, not Employee type. Hence the signature should be:

public boolean equals(Object obj) 

instead of

public boolean equals(Employee e).
